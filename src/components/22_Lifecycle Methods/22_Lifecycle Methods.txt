Four phases
1. Mounting: When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM
    . constructor
    . static getDerivedStateFromProps
    . render
    . componentDidMount

2. Updating: When a component is being re-rendering as a result of changes to either its props or state
    . static getDerivedStateFromProps
    . shouldComponentUdate
    . render
    . getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
    . componentDidUpdate

3. Unmounting: When a component is being removed from the DOM
    . componentWillUnmount

4. Error Handling: When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any  child component
    . static getDerivedStateFromError
    . componentDidCatch
