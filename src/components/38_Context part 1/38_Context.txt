part 1
. consider the following component architecture below:

                AppComponent
                      |
    ------------------+-----------------
    |                 |                |
    A                 B                C
                      |                |
                      D                E
                                       |
                                       F

. Assume that we need to show username in components A, D, and F. Such information is store in the AppComponent.
. To do that, we can simply pass the username as props from AppComponent down to A, D, and F.
. However, it is unnecessary to pass the props through the intermediate component B, C, and E.
. What would be nice if there is a way to send the data directly to the required component.

. "Context" provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.
