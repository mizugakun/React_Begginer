Error handling phase method
    1. static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
    2. componentDidCatch(error, info)

. React unmount the whole React component tree when the error occur
. How to catch the error and display the UI?

. Error boundaries:
. A class component that implements either one or both of the lifecycle methods, getDerivedStateFromError or componentDidCatch, becomes an error boundary
. Error boundaries can catch JavaScript error in their component tree, log those errors, and display a fall-back UI
. The static getDerivedStateFromError method is used to render a fallback UI after an error is thrown
. The componentDidCatch method is used to log the error information 
. The placement of the Error Boundary also matters as it coontrols if the entire app should have the fall-back UI or jusdt the component causing the problem
. Provide a way to gracefully handle error in application

. the error handling phase method catch the errors:
    . during rendering
    . in the constructor

. the error handling phase method DO NOT catch the errors:
    . event handling
