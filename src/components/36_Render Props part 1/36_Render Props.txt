part 1
. why there is a need for render props?
. --> pretty much the same reason for using HOC

part 2
. In React, it is possible to use props whose value is a function to control what is actually rendered by a component
. This is what render props pattern based on

. Definition:
. The term "render Prop" refer to a technique for sharing code between React component using a prop whose value is a function
    1. Create a component as the container that will record the state and implement the method
    2. The container doesn't render anything. It's gonna render whatever is passed as the "render props"
    3. The container will pass state and implmented method as props to the render props
    4. render prop: the component that we we'd like to render and pass state and method in
    5. Although the state is provided by the the same container component, two different render props will have different states within
    6. passing state and methos to children would be the better pattern
