When the component is re-render, the methood will be called because oof the chages of the state and prop.

1. static getDervicedStateFRomProps(pros, state)
    . method is called when the component is re-render
    . must return null or an object as a state of the component
    . this methid is used when the state depends on the props of the component
    . should not cause any side effect. eg. HTTP requests
    . rarely used

2. shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
    . dictate if the component should re-render or not
    . by default, all class component will re-render when their prop received or state chaged
    . can do: compare the existing prop or state with incoming value and return true or false to tell React whether update the component or not
    . for optomizing the performance
    . should not cause any side effect. eg. HTTP requests
    . should not call the setState method
    . rarely used

3. render()
    . only required method
    . read prop & state and return JSX
    . should not chage state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls

4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
    . method is called right before the changes from tthe virtual DOM are to be reflect in the DOM
    . can do: catch some informatioin in the DOM. ex: observe user's scroll positioin and maintain that after the updates by performing some calculation
    . return value: could be null, will be the parameter of next method: componentDidUpdate
    . rarely used

5. componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)
    . method will be called after the render is finished in the re-render cycles
    . this method should be called only once in each render cycle
    . can do: side effect
    . ex: compare the prevProps and Props and then decide whether to make an Ajax call or not


Unmounting phase method
1. componentWiillUnmount()
. method will be calleed iimmediatly beefore a component is unmounted and destroyed
. can do: cancelling any network requests, removing handlers, cancelling subscriptionss, or invalidating timers
. should not call setState method; the compoent is never re-render after it has been re-render


Error handling phase method
1. static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
2. componentDidcatch(error, info)

. these two methods will be called whenever there is an error either during the rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.
