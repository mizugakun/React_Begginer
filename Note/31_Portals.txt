. provide a way to render children into the DOM node which is outside the DOM hierachy of the parent component

. without any modification, the react will mount everythig in the DOM element whose ID is 'root' in ./public/index.html
. portals provide the ability to break out of this restriction
. --> allows user to render components onto a DOM node that is not in this root component

. use cases: inisert a child into different DOM to avoid messiing with parent's CSS style. ex: modal
. event bubbling: still propagate the event to the ancestor (parent component) no matter how DOM tree looks like
