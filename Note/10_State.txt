props vs state

1. getting passed to the component <--> is managed within the component
2. function parameters <--> variables declares in the function body
3. immutable <--> can be changed
4. props-functional Components <--> useState Hook-Functional Components
   this.props-Class Components <--> Class Components



setState:
1. Always make use of setState and never modify the state directly
2. if code has to be executed after teh state has been updated, place it at the call back function as the second arfument in setState method
3. When you have to update state based on the previous state value, pass in a function as an argument instead of the regular object.
