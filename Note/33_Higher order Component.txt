part 1
. Why do we need it? --> Reduce the duplicated codes

part 2
. what is HOC (Higher Order Component)

. a pattern where a function takes a component as an argument and returns a new component
. HOC could add additional data or functionality to teh original component
. ex: const NewComponent = higherComponent(originalComponent)
. ex: const EnhacncedComponent = higherComponent(originalComponent)
. ex: IronMan = withSuit(TonyStark)

. naming convention: 
    . the funtion name should be the functionality that will be added to the original component
    . the original component usually named as WrapedComponent, which is the component that is wraped with the HOC
    . the name of enhanced component should be the same as funciton name
